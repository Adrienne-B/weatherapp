Open weather API, type in the zip code and a weather like report will appear

## Summary
This was my first java project which it was about a type of API your application will make a request to a URL, kind of like how a browser goes to a web address. 
The server will parse the URL and determine what data was requested. Then that server will return the requested data in the JSON format.

### Software used:
Eclipse(java) and OpenWeatherMap.org

### What I learn:
